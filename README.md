# Switching-1-Phase-to-3-phase-with-GSM-and-Power-Theft-Detection
In this project we are going to use the Arduino microcontroller and GSM module. By using relay, we can simply switch from 1 phase to 3 phase by proving message from GSM. It will only switch means if 1 phase is on and if we want to switch to 3 phase then 1 phase will off and 3 phase will start.

For power theft, we are using 12v load, we calculate the load and if load is more than threshold then theft power message will appear on mobile phone.

 

#Components used:
